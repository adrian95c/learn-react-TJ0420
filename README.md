# Travel Journal

This small project is my first coursework from React learning modules from Scrimba. No doubt it is quite challenging during the solving process, but I'm so grateful to have resourceful guidance and direction, and, I managed to complete it finally.

This is for completing coursework purpose, not a real travel journal.
Of course, I would travel there some day in future.

# Lesson Learned
- Brushed up HTML and CSS
- Learned how to build something in imperative way (JSX) and render it with `ReactDOM` to html page.
- Learned how to build something `composable` by small reusable `component` and group together into bigger individual pieces.
- Learned how to proper handle/ pass `data`, `object` as `props` or use `.map()` method together sometimes.

```
ex : <img src={`../images/${props.item.coverImg}`} className="card--image" /> - passing JS into JSX
```

```
ex : <a ... target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" ...>View on Google Maps</a>
- noopener    : Ensure security which lets an attacker have partial access to the previous page.
- noreferrer  : Prevent other pages from seeing that traffic came from origin link.
- nofollow    : Avoid the influence on the search engine rankings of the destination URL.
```
